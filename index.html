                I've spent the majority of my life in Richmond, VA. I grew up in the West End and went to 
                Godwin HS and then went to college at The University of Richmond. After graduation from college, I moved to New Zealand
                with two friends for a year and worked as a tennis instructor. When I left New Zealand, I had a flight to Los Angeles 
                and then rode a bicycle accross the country to get back to the east coast. I currently live in Richmond, VA with my lovely wife, Meghann, my two sons, Braydan and Luke, and 
                  my dog, Riley. We enjoy spending time together and being outdoors.

                I have been working at Genworth Finalcial for about 7 years. I started out working in operations as a long term 
                care claim representative. After a few years I moved into IT as a QA tester where I stayed for about 3 years. 
                After testing an in house developed .NET claims software, the copy decided to build a new workflow application using Pega. 
                After testing in Pega for about a year, I decided I wanted to spend my time developing the code instead of testing it. I 
                obtained my Pega Certified System Architect (CSA) and was hired as a developer. Since then, I have also obtained my 
                Certified Senior System Architect (CSSA) certifications. Since I don't have a background in computer science, I am really looking
                foward to learning some concepts that will help in my day to day activities and also help when I converse with members of other teams
                at my job.

                In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family, running around with my kids and spending time with friends drinking 
                over priced craft beer. I also really enjoy playing sports, especially golf and tennis.
