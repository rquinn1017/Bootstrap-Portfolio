                      Godwin HS and then went to college at The University of Richmond. After graduation from college, I moved to New Zealand
                      with two friends for a year and worked as a tennis instructor. When I left New Zealand, I had a flight to Los Angeles 
                      and then rode a bicycle accross the country to get back to the east coast. I currently live in Richmond, VA with my lovely wife, Meghann, my two sons, Braydan and Luke, and 
                        my dog, Riley. We enjoy spending time together and being outdoors.

                              After testing an in house developed .NET claims software, the copy decided to build a new workflow application using Pega. 
                              After testing in Pega for about a year, I decided I wanted to spend my time developing the code instead of testing it. I 
                              obtained my Pega Certified System Architect (CSA) and was hired as a developer. Since then, I have also obtained my 
                              Certified Senior System Architect (CSSA) certifications. Since I don't have a background in computer science, I am really looking
                              foward to learning some concepts that will help in my day to day activities and also help when I converse with members of other
